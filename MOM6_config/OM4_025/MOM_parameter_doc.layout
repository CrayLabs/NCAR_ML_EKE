! === module MOM ===
GLOBAL_INDEXING = False         !   [Boolean] default = False
                                ! If true, use a global lateral indexing convention, so that corresponding
                                ! points on different processors have the same index. This does not work with
                                ! static memory.

! === module MOM_domains ===
!SYMMETRIC_MEMORY_ = False      !   [Boolean]
                                ! If defined, the velocity point data domain includes every face of the
                                ! thickness points. In other words, some arrays are larger than others,
                                ! depending on where they are on the staggered grid.  Also, the starting index
                                ! of the velocity-point arrays is usually 0, not 1. This can only be set at
                                ! compile time.
NONBLOCKING_UPDATES = False     !   [Boolean] default = False
                                ! If true, non-blocking halo updates may be used.
THIN_HALO_UPDATES = True        !   [Boolean] default = True
                                ! If true, optional arguments may be used to specify the the width of the halos
                                ! that are updated with each call.
!STATIC_MEMORY_ = False         !   [Boolean]
                                ! If STATIC_MEMORY_ is defined, the principle variables will have sizes that are
                                ! statically determined at compile time.  Otherwise the sizes are not determined
                                ! until run time. The STATIC option is substantially faster, but does not allow
                                ! the PE count to be changed at run time.  This can only be set at compile time.
MASKTABLE = "mask_table.622.36x72" ! default = "MOM_mask_table"
                                ! A text file to specify n_mask, layout and mask_list. This feature masks out
                                ! processors that contain only land points. The first line of mask_table is the
                                ! number of regions to be masked out. The second line is the layout of the model
                                ! and must be consistent with the actual model layout. The following (n_mask)
                                ! lines give the logical positions of the processors that are masked out. The
                                ! mask_table can be created by tools like check_mask. The following example of
                                ! mask_table masks out 2 processors, (1,2) and (3,6), out of the 24 in a 4x6
                                ! layout:
                                !  2
                                !  4,6
                                !  1,2
                                !  3,6

                                ! The number of processors in the y-direction. With STATIC_MEMORY_ this is set

                                ! be the same as the layout.
